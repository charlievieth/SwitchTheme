# SwitchTheme

SwitchTheme is a [Sublime Text 4](http://sublimetext.com/) plugin that adds a
[Application](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/api_reference.html#sublime_plugin.ApplicationCommand)
command (`switch_theme`) to switch between light and dark themes. This duplicates
a bit of the `"color_scheme": "auto"` setting, but allows switching themes
independent of the operating system appearance.
